# Fashion_MNIST_Classifier
 Fashion MNIST classifier using CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks). The Fashion_Mnist dataset is one of the most famous dataset to learn and explpore the world of deep learning and CNN. 
                                                  The dataset is explored, and then wrangled for the ease of classification. Then it is classified using CNN layers with the help of dropouts(to avoid over fitting of the data).
                                                  The optimiser used here is Adam. The training achieved is 98.98% and the final validation accuracy achievd is 91.24%.
                                                  The accuracies and the losses are then ploted using matplotlib for the ease of understanding of the viewers.
